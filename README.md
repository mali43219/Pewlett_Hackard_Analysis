# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

ANALYSIS: Deliverable 3

__________________________________________________________________________________

Purpose: 
    
    This analysis aims to help Pewlett-Hackard, a company with thousands of employees, prepare for the upcoming "silver tsunami" of retirements. It will focus on identifying retiring employees by their title, determining the number of retiring employees in each title, identifying employees eligible for mentorship programs, and determining the number of open roles and qualified, retirement-ready employees to mentor the next generation, all grouped by title and department. This will help ensure a smooth transition as employees begin to retire at a rapid rate in the coming years.



Results

    1. A complete list of retiring employees:
        
        The query returned over 133k employees. This list gives us some insight but is very extensive. Some of the employees appeared more than once due to their long career at Pewlett Hackard. 
    
    2.  A complete list of retiring employees without duplicates:

         The query returned over 90k employees, each is listed only once, by their most recent title. 

    3.  A complete list of retiring employees by title:

         The query returned 7 different titles, where we can see how many employees with certain title will retire in the next few years.

    4. A complete list of employees eligible for the mentorship program:

         The query returned over 1500 employees who are eligible for the mentorship program.
